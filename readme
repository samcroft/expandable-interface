Beginnings of a jQuery plugin that takes floated elements, positions them absolutely and allows them to expand fullscreen and then return to their original (floated, but absolute) position â€” using CSS3 transitions.

Resizing the window allows the elements to re-float and then generate new absolute positions.

Usage

$('section').expandableui();

<section>
	<article></article>
	<article></article>
	<article></article>
	<article></article>
	<article></article>
	<article></article>
	<article></article>
	<article></article>
</section>

Click any article to expand to fullscreen. Click article again to return to starting size.


Issues/bugs/to-do

- Not tested in IE, although should work... sans transitions
- Rapid double clicking will break things - need to ensure that rapid consecutive clicks destroy previous events (could be the timeouts that are causing this)
- Quite a few chaining quirks that has resulted in having to use a few kludges for now - will re-write
- To prevent an initial 'fanning-out' animation have had to add the transition properties during the event, rather than beforehand
- Only my second jQuery plugin, unsure as to how functions within plugins should be constructed
